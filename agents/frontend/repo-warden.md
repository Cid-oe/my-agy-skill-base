<role>

Lightweight axis scorer for /oss:analyse (vitality mode). Reads pre-fetched raw JSONL, scores assigned axis group per vitality-scoring.md rubric. Writes partial scores JSON. Runs parallel with 2 other repo-warden instances.

NOT for data fetching — raw data comes from DATA_FILE written by oss:gh-scraper. NOT for report generation, terminal output, or adversarial review — /oss:analyse (vitality mode) Steps 4–7 own those.

</role>

<inputs>

Prompt supplies key=value pairs (space-separated):

- `GH_OWNER=<owner>` — GitHub owner or org (required)
- `GH_REPO=<repo>` — GitHub repository name (required)
- `DATA_FILE=<path>` — path to JSONL written by oss:gh-scraper
- `PARTIAL_FILE=<path>` — output path for group's partial scores JSON
- `AXIS_GROUP=A|B|C` — axis group to score: A=1,2,5,6 · B=4,7,8 · C=3,9

</inputs>

<workflow>

## Step 1 — Setup

Parse `GH_OWNER`, `GH_REPO`, `DATA_FILE`, `PARTIAL_FILE`, `AXIS_GROUP` from prompt key=value pairs.

```bash
export CSID="${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-$PPID}"
# loads: oss-shared-resolver.md
# intentional boilerplate; also in gh-scraper.md, shepherd.md
_OSS_SHARED=$(python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/cc_oss}/bin/resolve_shared_path.py" oss skills/_shared 2>/dev/null)  # timeout: 5000
[ -z "$_OSS_SHARED" ] && _OSS_SHARED="plugins/cc_oss/skills/_shared"
echo "$_OSS_SHARED" > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/warden-oss-shared-${CSID}"  # persist (Check 41)
```

Determine axes for group:

- Group A: Axes 1, 2, 5, 6
- Group B: Axes 4, 7, 8
- Group C: Axes 3, 9

```bash
AXIS_GROUP="$(echo "$AXIS_GROUP" | tr -d '[:space:]')"  # trim whitespace from prompt parsing  # timeout: 5000
case "$AXIS_GROUP" in
  A) AXES="1 2 5 6" ;;
  B) AXES="4 7 8" ;;
  C) AXES="3 9" ;;
  *) echo "[repo-warden] ERROR: unknown AXIS_GROUP=$AXIS_GROUP"; exit 1 ;;
esac
echo "[repo-warden] group=$AXIS_GROUP axes=$AXES repo=$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO"  # timeout: 5000
```

## Step 2 — Load Data

Read `$DATA_FILE` fully via Read tool. Parse JSONL records into in-memory structures for assigned axis group.

**Group A** (Axes 1, 2, 5, 6): extract `responsiveness_gql`, `commits`, `releases`, `ci_workflows`, `ci_runs`, `repo_metadata`. Root file list from `repo_metadata` or separate `contents` record. README and workflow content from `readme_content` and `workflow_files` if written by gh-scraper; else infer from `ci_workflows` names.

**Group B** (Axes 4, 7, 8): extract `open_issues`, `closed_issues`, `open_prs`, `closed_prs`, `review_coverage_gql`, `dependabot_alerts`, `secret_scanning_alerts`, `repo_metadata`. Root file list from `repo_metadata`. Governance files from `root_contents`, `github_dir`, `codeowners_content`, `branch_protection`, `dependabot_config` if present.

**Group C** (Axes 3, 9): extract `contributor_stats`, `merged_prs_90d`, `commits_50`, `releases`, `fork_dates`, `star_dates`, `open_issues` (reused for 9C).

```bash
ANALYSIS_NOW=$(jq -r '.timestamp // empty' "$DATA_FILE" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || TZ=UTC date +%s)  # timeout: 5000
CUTOFF_30D=$((ANALYSIS_NOW - 30*86400))  # CRITICAL-1: explicit 30d cutoff for Axis 9B window_30d filter
```

## Step 3 — Score Axes

```bash
export CSID="${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-$PPID}"
IFS= read -r _OSS_SHARED < "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/warden-oss-shared-${CSID}" 2>/dev/null || _OSS_SHARED="plugins/cc_oss/skills/_shared"  # reload (Check 41)
case "$AXIS_GROUP" in
  A) _GROUP_FILE="vitality-scoring-group-a.md" ;;
  B) _GROUP_FILE="vitality-scoring-group-b.md" ;;
  C) _GROUP_FILE="vitality-scoring-group-c.md" ;;
esac
[ -f "$_OSS_SHARED/$_GROUP_FILE" ] || { echo "[repo-warden] ERROR: $_GROUP_FILE not found at $_OSS_SHARED — verify oss plugin installation"; exit 1; }  # timeout: 5000
cat "$_OSS_SHARED/$_GROUP_FILE"  # timeout: 5000
```

Contains only assigned group's axis rubrics (not full 13-axis file). Score each axis in assigned group per rubric. Use raw data from Step 2. Per-axis weight table and confidence-threshold floors live in `vitality-scoring.md` (§ Weights & Confidence Thresholds) — read that file too if weight or floor value needed; group files omit it to avoid duplication.

**Group A** — any order (all independent; no cross-axis dependency; no internal parallelism needed):

1. Axis 1 — Responsiveness: use `responsiveness_gql`; compute median_issue_response_days, median_pr_response_days, pct_responded_7d, pct_unresponded per rubric; exclude author's own responses. **Zero-sample guard**: if PR sample count = 0 (no PRs in window), set `median_pr_response_days = "N/A"`, exclude PR metrics from axis score — use issue metrics only; note data gap in signal string
2. Axis 2 — Maintenance Activity: use `commits` dates and `releases`; compute days_since_last_commit, commits_30d, commits_90d, release cadence
3. Axis 5 — CI/CD & Code Quality: use `ci_workflows`, `ci_runs`, root file list; evaluate 5 checkpoints per rubric
4. Axis 6 — Documentation: use README content, root file list, `.github/` directory listing, CONTRIBUTING.md content; evaluate 9 checkpoints per rubric

**Group B** — any order (all independent; no cross-axis dependency):

1. Axis 4 — Issue & PR Health: use `open_issues`, `closed_issues`, `open_prs`, `closed_prs`, `review_coverage_gql`; compute stale%, close_rate, merge_rate, review_coverage; filter bot PRs
2. Axis 7 — Governance: use root file list, `.github/` dir, CODEOWNERS content, branch protection response; evaluate 7 checkpoints per rubric (max_applicable = 7 or 6 per checkpoint 7 applicability)
3. Axis 8 — Security Posture: use `dependabot_alerts` (403-tolerant), `secret_scanning_alerts` (403-tolerant), dep config signals, SECURITY.md depth; apply partial-scoring formula when Dependabot 403. For `secret_scanning_alerts`: if record is non-403 and non-empty, treat each open alert as equivalent risk to a Dependabot high alert — integrate into the scoring bands the same way Dependabot high-severity counts do; if 403 or absent, mark secret scanning signal as unavailable (does not trigger ⚪)

**Group C** — sequential (Axis 3 FIRST, mandatory):

1. Axis 3 — Contributor Health: use `contributor_stats` (weeks[] data); filter bots; compute bus_factor, top_contributor_pct, retention_rate; apply 202-fallback from `commits_50` if stats unavailable; after scoring, write an **intermediate** JSON to `${PARTIAL_FILE%.json}-axis3-tmp.json` (NOT to `PARTIAL_FILE` — intermediate write must not trigger health monitor's file-existence signal prematurely) with only `{"axis3_weeks": [...]}` (or `{"axis3_weeks": null}` on fallback) — temporary passthrough for Axis 9A; Step 4 writes final PARTIAL_FILE. Bash variables don't persist across tool calls — must persist via file.
2. Axis 9 — Trajectory: after Axis 3 intermediate write complete, score all 4 sub-signals:
   - 9A (reviewer pool drift): reads `axis3_weeks` from `${PARTIAL_FILE%.json}-axis3-tmp.json` written by Axis 3 above (not bash variable); compute shrinkage_ratio from pool_recent vs pool_prior; if Axis 3 used fallback (`axis3_weeks: null`), mark 9A ⚪
   - 9B (time-to-merge trend): uses `merged_prs_90d`; filter bots; compute median_30d vs median_90d; trend_ratio
   - 9C (queue staleness depth): uses `open_issues` (reused from JSONL); compute P90 age
   - 9D (commit substance ratio): uses `commits_50`; dep_ratio = dep-bump commits / total
   - **star velocity (Axis 9E sub-signal)**: if `star_dates` absent from DATA_FILE (gh-scraper does not collect per-star timestamps), skip star velocity scoring entirely — mark as N/A with note "star data unavailable"; do not infer or estimate star velocity from total star count alone. Note: this is a trajectory sub-signal (Axis 9), not a security sub-signal (Axis 8)
   - Axis 9 overall = mean of available sub-signals (0–10 float)

Per axis, produce result object:

```json
{
  "score": 7.5,
  "label": "🟢",
  "conf": 0.92,
  "signal": "one-line key signal",
  "notes": "brief evidence notes"
}
```

Unavailable axes (all API calls failed):

```json
{
  "score": null,
  "label": "⚪",
  "conf": 0.0,
  "signal": "data unavailable",
  "unavailable_reason": "<reason>"
}
```

⚪ axes: set `score: null` and `conf: 0.0` in partial file (assembler treats null as excluded from health score).

Signal string formats (must match scorecard Key Signal column):

| Axis | Format string |
| -- | -- |
| 1 | `"median issue ${median_issue_response_days}d, PR ${median_pr_response_days}d; ${pct_responded_7d_pct}% ≤7d"` — use `"N/A"` for `median_pr_response_days` when zero PRs in sample |
| 2 | `"last commit ${days_since_last_commit}d, ${commits_30d} commits/30d"` |
| 3 | `"bus factor ${bus_factor}, retention ${retention_pct}%"` |
| 4 | `"stale ${stale_pct}%, close rate ${close_rate}, review cov ${review_coverage_pct}%"` |
| 5 | `"${ci_checkpoints_met}/5 checks, CI pass rate ${ci_pass_rate_pct}%"` |
| 6 | `"${doc_checkpoints_met}/9 checkpoints"` |
| 7 | `"${gov_checkpoints_met}/${max_applicable} files, active maint ${active_maintainers}/${listed_maintainers}"` |
| 8 | `"dep-config: ${dep_config_present}, alerts: ${dependabot_alert_summary}"` |
| 9 | `"pool drift: ${pool_drift_pct}%, TTM 30d: ${median_30d}d vs 90d: ${median_90d}d, P90 queue: ${p90_age_days}d, dep-bump: ${dep_ratio_pct}%"` |

## Step 4 — Write Partial Scores

Write `$PARTIAL_FILE` via Write tool — do not use Bash with `echo`/`cat` redirection. Use the Write tool to create this file.

**Single parameterized template** — substitute `{{GROUP}}` and `{{AXES}}` per assigned group, emit one `axes` entry per axis in `{{AXES}}`:

```json
{
  "group": "{{GROUP}}",
  "gh_repo": "GH_OWNER/GH_REPO",
  "scored_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "axes": {
    "{{AXIS}}": { "score": N, "label": "🟢|🟡|🔴|⚪", "conf": 0.N, "signal": "...", "notes": "..." }
  },
  "axis3_weeks": {{AXIS3_WEEKS}}
}
```

Substitution per group:

| `{{GROUP}}` | `{{AXES}}` (one `axes` entry each) | `{{AXIS3_WEEKS}}` |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `A` | 1, 2, 5, 6 | `null` |
| `B` | 4, 7, 8 | `null` |
| `C` | 3, 9 | actual weeks[] array from contributor stats (`null` when fallback used) |

`axis3_weeks` is always `null` for Groups A and B — only Group C emits the array. Group C sets it to the actual weeks[] array from contributor stats (or `null` when fallback used). Assembler reads this field for confidence display.

```bash
echo "[repo-warden] group=$AXIS_GROUP complete → $PARTIAL_FILE"  # timeout: 5000
```

## Step 5 — Return Envelope

Compute group confidence as mean of per-axis confidence values (exclude ⚪ axes with conf=0.0; if all ⚪ return 0.0). Cap: strictly less than half assigned axes scored (e.g. 1 of 4 in Group A; 1 of 3 in Group B — NOT 1 of 2 in Group C, which equals exactly half) → cap group confidence at 0.7 to reflect incomplete coverage.

**Group C multi-axis cap**: 0.85 cap applies when >3 top-level axes scored (Group C currently scores 2 — cap inactive unless scope expands; Axis 9 sub-signals count as one axis).

Return ONLY this JSON as final output:

`{"status":"done","file":"$PARTIAL_FILE","group":"$AXIS_GROUP","axes_scored":N,"confidence":0.N}`

</workflow>

<notes>

- **⚪ coding**: unavailable axes use `score: null, conf: 0.0, label: "⚪"` in partial file; assembler renormalizes weights over available axes only; Group C with 1 of 2 axes ⚪ = 50% scored — treat as ≥ half (cap rule does NOT apply); Group C with both axes ⚪ = 0% scored — return `score: null` for whole group
- **Bot filtering**: applies in Axes 3, 4, 7 (checkpoint 7), 9A, 9B, 9D — exclude logins matching `*[bot]` or `*-bot` suffix OR matching known-bot names (`pre-commit-ci`, `mergify`, `allcontributors`, `renovate`, `dependabot`); use bash: `[[ "$login" == *"[bot]"* ]] || [[ "$login" == *"-bot" ]] || [[ "$login" == "pre-commit-ci" ]] || [[ "$login" == "mergify" ]] || [[ "$login" == "allcontributors" ]] || [[ "$login" == "renovate" ]] || [[ "$login" == "dependabot" ]]`; authoritative bot signal is `user.type == "Bot"` from GitHub User API — pattern matching may miss novel bots; conservative choice: under-filter rather than over-filter human contributors
- **Confidence degraders**: apply per-axis degraders from vitality-scoring.md § Per-Axis Confidence Thresholds; never inflate above 1.0
- **Axis 3 fallback**: stats 202 after all retries → use commit-author approximation from `commits_50`; bus_factor approximation = distinct commit authors in commits_50 contributing ≥5% of total commits; mark conf=0.5; always attempt fallback before marking ⚪
- **Axis 8 partial scoring**: Dependabot 403 → partial_score formula from rubric; conf=0.4; never mark ⚪ solely from Dependabot 403
- **axis3_weeks field**: Group C must populate even if Axis 9 uses it; set `null` when fallback used (no weeks[] available); PARTIAL_FILE paths assigned by spawning skill (/oss:analyse (vitality mode)) with distinct suffixes per group (e.g., -group-A.json, -group-B.json, -group-C.json) — concurrent writes don't collide
- **Null substitution**: when metric used in signal string is null or unavailable, substitute `"n/a"` — e.g., `"median_pr_response_days: n/a"`; never leave bare `${null}` or empty substitution in signal

</notes>

<antipatterns-to-flag>

- **Conflating activity with health**: high commit frequency or star count ≠ healthy project; repo can actively accumulate tech-debt or security issues while appearing busy — always score maintenance quality (Axis 2) and security posture (Axis 8) independently of raw activity counts.
- **Over-weighting CI badge count**: presence of workflow files doesn't imply passing CI; score Axis 5 on `ci_pass_rate` and actual checkpoint signals (test/lint/SAST), not badge count or workflow file count alone.
- **Treating zero open issues as health signal**: zero open issues most often indicates dormant/abandoned project, not perfect one — cross-check against `days_since_last_commit` and contributor activity before assigning positive score on Axis 4.
